## Hello 🤟, and thanks for stopping by!

# Thu Dang 🇨🇦
Thanks for stopping by! Let me start by saying, be more bold in what you do; I'm starting to realize more and more as I get older, pick, commit, and if it fails, adapt.

I love people (humanity, compassion, empathy first, please!) and I love learning (tech and just science in general, history, everything really). I'm a technical recruiter who focuses on relationships to find matches between what you want and what you're looking for.

This is me affecting a bit of the change I hope to see in the 🌎. So don't be shy, reach out. Additional things we can talk about, IYKYK: EDC, homesteading, passive house/net zero, four seasons greenhouses & gardening, geothermal, solar, wind power generation, cooking, sauna, and a few other topics I seem to be constantly reading up and researching on.

My missions:
-ending poverty (UBI - universal basic income) through crypto. I hope to get there one day, and would love to network with people who have similar interests.
-revamping eduction and the way we think: big fan of contextual learning for schools
-ending world hunger - greentech, biodiversity
-"crazy" business ideas and spreading the word: I've got a few articles (Crazy Ideas Platform - CIP) on my LinkedIn profile
